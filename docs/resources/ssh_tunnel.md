# artie_ssh_tunnel (Resource)

Artie SSH Tunnel resource. This resource allows you to create an SSH tunnel to connect to your source or destination databases.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "artie_ssh_tunnel" "ssh_tunnel" {
  name     = "SSH Tunnel"
  host     = "1.2.3.4"
  port     = 22
  username = "artie"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `host` (String) The public hostname or IP address of your SSH server.
- `name` (String) A human-readable label for this SSH tunnel.
- `port` (Number) The port number of your SSH server.
- `username` (String) The username we should use when connecting to your SSH server.

### Read-Only

- `public_key` (String, Sensitive) When you create an SSH tunnel in Artie, we generate a public/private key pair. Once generated, you'll need to add this public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on your SSH server.
- `uuid` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Import an SSH tunnel by using its UUID, which you can find by:
# 1. Go to the pipeline overview page in the Artie UI (for a pipeline that uses this SSH tunnel)
# 2. Open the dropdown in the top right corner
# 3. Select "View UUIDs" to see all related resource UUIDs
terraform import artie_ssh_tunnel.my_ssh_tunnel <ssh_tunnel_uuid>

# Then print the state and copy it into your terraform config file
# (be sure to remove all read-only fields, like `uuid`):
terraform state show artie_ssh_tunnel.my_ssh_tunnel
```
